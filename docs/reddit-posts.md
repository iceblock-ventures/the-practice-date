# Reddit Post Variations — The Practice Date Launch

## Variation 1: r/socialskills

**Title:** I built an AI voice coach to practice flirting — because reading tips online wasn't cutting it

**Body:**

Hey everyone. I've been lurking here for a while and noticed a pattern: tons of great advice about conversation skills, but very few ways to actually *practice* without the stakes.

So I built **The Practice Date** — it's an AI voice coach where you pick a scenario (coffee date, bar meetup, etc.), have a real spoken conversation, and get honest feedback on how you did.

It scores you on things like confidence, humor, engagement, and flow. No cringe pickup lines — it's about learning to be genuinely fun to talk to.

It's free to try: [thepracticedate.com](https://thepracticedate.com)

Would love feedback from this community. What scenarios would you want to practice?

## Variation 2: r/dating_advice

**Title:** I kept freezing up on dates, so I built an AI to practice with first

**Body:**

I'm decent at texting but the second I'm face-to-face (or on a call), my brain goes blank. I'd leave dates thinking "why didn't I say that?"

So I built something for people like me: **The Practice Date**. It's a voice-based AI coach — you actually *talk* to it like a real conversation, pick different date scenarios, and it gives you a breakdown of what worked and what didn't.

Think of it like a flight simulator but for flirting. You get reps in a zero-judgment zone so the real thing feels less scary.

Free to try at [thepracticedate.com](https://thepracticedate.com). Curious what you all think.

## Variation 3: r/confidence

**Title:** The #1 thing that helped my conversation confidence: just getting more reps

**Body:**

I used to overthink every interaction. Then I realized confidence isn't something you think your way into — it comes from repetition.

Problem is, you can't exactly ask strangers to let you practice flirting on them. So I built **The Practice Date** — an AI voice coach that lets you have realistic date conversations and gives you feedback after.

It's not about memorizing lines. It's about getting comfortable being yourself in conversation, so when it matters, you're not in your head.
