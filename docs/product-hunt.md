An AI voice coach for date conversations. Pick a scenario, have a real spoken conversation, and get scored on confidence, humor, and flow. Like reps for rizz.

## Full Description

### The Problem
Reading dating advice online doesn't make you better at conversations — just like reading about basketball doesn't make you a better player. You need reps.

### The Solution
**The Practice Date** is an AI voice coach that lets you practice realistic date conversations and get honest feedback.

**How it works:**
1. 🎭 **Pick a scenario** — coffee date, bar meetup, running into someone at a bookstore
2. 🎙️ **Have a real conversation** — speak naturally, the AI responds like an actual person
3. 📊 **Get scored** — confidence, humor, engagement, conversation flow
4. 🔄 **Iterate** — review what worked, try again, improve

### Who it's for
Anyone who wants to be more comfortable and confident in conversations — especially date conversations. No cringe pickup lines, no manipulation tactics. Just practice being genuinely fun to talk to.

### Why we built it
Conversation is a skill. Skills improve with practice. But you can't practice dating conversations without... going on dates. Until now.

## Maker Comment

Hey PH! 👋

We built The Practice Date because we kept seeing the same thing: people with great personalities who freeze up the moment the conversation "counts."

The insight was simple — conversation confidence comes from reps, not tips. So we built a voice-based AI coach that gives you those reps in a zero-stakes environment.

Would love your feedback. What scenarios would you want to practice?
